1. sudo apt-get install tshark
2. Install Leap Linux software (the SDK is optional, but we need the .deb files that include leapd, etc.) (https://developer.leapmotion.com/downloads/installer-preview)
        (after downloading, sudo dpkg -i (WHICHEVER DEB IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR ARCH))
3. Run "LeapControlPanel" once, allowing the leap to update or do whatever it wants to do.
4. Close LeapControlPanel (and its tray applet)
5. Run "make"
